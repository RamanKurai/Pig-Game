# Pig Game

## Overview
The Pig Game is a simple dice game in which players take turns rolling a single die to accumulate points. The objective is to reach a target score, typically 100, before your opponents.

## How to Play
1. The game can be played by two or more players.
2. On each turn, a player rolls a standard six-sided die:
   - If the player rolls a 1, they score no points for that turn and it becomes the next player's turn.
   - If the player rolls a number other than 1, the number rolled is added to the player's turn total.
3. The player can choose to:
   - Roll Again: Roll the die again and continue adding to their turn total.
   - Hold: End their turn and add the turn total to their overall score.
4. The first player to reach the target score (usually 100) wins the game.

## Rules
- If a player rolls two consecutive 1s (snake eyes), they lose all points accumulated in that turn and their turn ends.
- Some variations include additional rules, such as requiring a player to score exactly 100 to win or allowing players to set custom target scores.
